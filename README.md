# Anomaly Detection with PCA and Deep Autoencoder
This repository hosts my work on the evaluation of four types anomaly detectors on different datasets. 

## Methods of Anoamly Detection

Four methods of Anomaly Detection are implemented and evaluated on each of the dataset
- **PCA based Reconstruction Error Method**: The dataset is reconstructed with [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) method, and the anomalous data points are detected based on the distance between the original and reconstructed representation.
- **PCA based Multivariate Gaussian Method**: The dataset is encoded with PCA method, and the anomalous data points are detected by applying a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution on the encoded dataset
- **Deep Autoencoder based Reconstruction Error Method**: A deep autoencoder is trained with the normal dataset with the goal to fully represent the original dataset. Then the dataset is reconstructed with the Deep Autoencoder model, and the anomalous data points are detected based on the distance between the original and reconstructed representation.
- **Deep Autoencoder based Multivariate Gaussian Method**: The dataset is encoded with the trained Deep Autoencoder model, and the anomalous data points are detected by applying a Multivariate Gaussian Distribution on the encoded dataset.

## Datasets
- [**Yale Faces Dataset**](/Yale_Faces_Data): [Faces dataset from Computer Vision Lab](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~iskwak/ExtYaleDatabase/ExtYaleB.html) in Yale University. The anomalies in the dataset are all photos of people with mustache
- [**MNIST**](/MNIST): the photos of handwritten digits released by [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). The anomalies in the dataset are all photos of the digit 2
- [**Synthetic Dataset 1**](/Synthetic): artificial dataset synthesized by myself. It is a binary dataset with dimension of 16 and generated with a multivariate gaussian distribution. The anomalies are vectors whose total number of '1s' in th vector is less than the threshold (4).
- [**Synthetic Dataset 2**](/Synthetic_2): It is also a binary dataset with dimension of 16 and generated with a multivariate gaussian distribution. The anomalies are vectors whose sum of the right n-1 digits is even and the left-most digit is odd (1)
- [**Synthetic Dataset 3**](/Synthetic_3): It is a binary dataset with dimension of 16 and generated with three multivariate gaussian distributions. The data generated with one distribution is treated and normal, and the data generated by the other two distribution is treated as anomalous.
- [**Synthetic Dataset 4**](/Synthetic_4): It is a binary dataset with dimension of 16 and generated with two multivariate gaussian distributions. The anomalies are vectors whose total number of '1s' in th vector is less than the threshold (4).

## Some Visualization
